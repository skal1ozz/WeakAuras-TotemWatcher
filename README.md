# WeakAuras-TotemWatcher
Weak Auras script, helps shamans to see when and which totem was destroyed/expired.
It's very helpful in pvp, for example when they are trying to kill your tremor totem.
You see notification right when they successfully cast the spell on the totem (not when the totem's already gone) 
so you can re-drop your totem right away without being full-feared.
